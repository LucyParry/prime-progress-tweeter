# prime-progress-tweeter
Periodically tweets to report on the local machine's progress searching for Mersenne prime numbers as part of the The Great Internet Mersenne Prime Search (GIMPS) distributed computing project (more information is at https://www.mersenne.org/). 

This is not affiliated with them in any way, it's mostly just to practice my Python, which otherwise I'd only really used in short bursts for data analysis in Jupyter notebooks or to study algorithms as part of my <a href="http://www.open.ac.uk/">OU</a> Computing degree.
