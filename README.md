# prime-progress-tweeter
Periodically (and excitedly) tweets to report on the local machine's progress searching for Mersenne prime numbers as part of the The Great Internet Mersenne Prime Search (GIMPS) distributed computing project, based at https://www.mersenne.org/). 

This is not officially affiliated with them in any way, it's just for fun. Having only really used Python for little 'sketches' to look at algorithm implementations or data analysis (mostly for <a href="http://www.open.ac.uk/">OU</a> Computing degree.), I wanted to make something slightly more substantial for practice.
