# prime-progress-tweeter
Periodically tweets to report on the local machine's progress searching for Mersenne prime numbers with the prime95 software available as part of The Great Internet Mersenne Prime Search (GIMPS). 

GIMPS is a distributed computing project for finding Mersenne primes (more information is at https://www.mersenne.org/). 

This is not affiliated with them in any way, it's just a little thing I built for giggles and to practice my Python (which I've only really used to study algorithms and for data analysis with my <a href="http://www.open.ac.uk/">OU</a> Degree but never professionally for an actual *application* ). You can see the fruit of it's (tiny) labours at https://twitter.com/flap_bot
