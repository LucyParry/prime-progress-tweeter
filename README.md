# prime-progress-tweeter
Periodically tweets to report on the local machine's progress searching for Mersenne prime numbers with the prime95 software available as part of The Great Internet Mersenne Prime Search (GIMPS). 

GIMPS is a distributed computing project for finding Mersenne primes (more information is at https://www.mersenne.org/). 

This is not affiliated with them in any way, it's just a little thing I built for giggles and Python practice. You can see the fruit of it's (tiny) labours at https://twitter.com/flap_bot
